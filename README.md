### Sumamry
This project was designed by me to practice working with React state in a responsive and user friendly way.   
ColorPick allows you to change the sliders to pick the color of your dreams. Click the HSLa text to _instantly_ copy the HSLa values to your clipboard.  When you have selected a color that you would like to keep, click the 'Store This Color' button to store the color below.
